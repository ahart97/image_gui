ImageGUI
==============================

This repository contains a PyQT GUI that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, as well as the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture to complete image and object detection/classification. The code is implemented using PyTorch, PyQT5, OpenCV, Python 3, and NumPy.

Example of the GUI can be seen below:

![plot](./data/processed/example.png)

The image classification is still in progress

## Models

The YOLO weights can be found [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights). Download this file and place in the "./models/Yolo" folder

## Setup

To start using the GUI follow the steps below:

- Download the yolo weights from the link above
- Install the python requirements in requirements.txt
- Plug in a webcam
- Run the following in the python environment

```
python main.py
```
